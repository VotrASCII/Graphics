# SODIUM POTASSIUM PUMP

I've simplified the structures, to very large extent. Easier to Understand and implement!!

Finally, it's done!! A little description:
  * Initally, the entire structure is in state of equilibrium.
  * Higher number of Na+ ion results in outer region of the cell to have increased affinity for Na+ ions.
  * To compensate the outward flow of Na+ from inside to outside K+ from outside flows from outside to inside.
  * The above mentioned actions take place at expense of energy which is generated by ATP.

I've shown flow of 1 set of 3Na+ and 1 set of 2K+.
  * The flow of Na+ from inside to outside and K+ from outside to inside results in setting up of ELECTROCHEMICAL GRADIENT, shown by Concentration Gradient.
  * When the gradient indicator is green means enough potential energy has been generated for active transport of glucose from outside of the cell to inside of the cell against higher concentration gradient.
  * With enough potential gradient, the channel protein opens up through which the glucose is transported from outside of the cell to inside.
  
Well, that's all about it!! :-)
