Concept:
Sodium Potassium pump:
--> movement of ions against their concentration gradient 
--> 3Na+ for every 2K+
--> movement on the expense of energy released on phosphorylsis of ATP to ADP and energy

Implementation: (2D)
Cell Membrane "void cell_membrane(void);":
* the region that show the cell extension and is used to distinguish the outer region and inner region of the cell
* static region
* shows no movement, only helps in distinguishing inside and outside of the cell
* opening on the inner region to let Na+ from inside to outside
* opening on the outer region to let K+ from outside to inside

Na+:
* circular in shape with "Na+" written on it.
* show fluidic motion #camera function : +X
* higher concentration outside, lower inside the plasma membrane 

K+:
* circular in shape with K+ written on it
* Note: radius K+>Na+
* higher concentation inside, lower on the outside of plasma membrane
* show fluidic motion #camera function : -X

Glucose:
* hexagonal shape; since C.6-H.12-O.6
* movement of glucose on expense of energy from electro-chemical gradient
* two functions to define the movement:
* void glucose_out_in(void): the ones that will transit from outside to inside
* void glucose_out_in(void): the ones which will just stay outside

ATP action:
* attaches itself to the cell by phosphorylsis action releasing ADP and energy
* this energy is responsible for conformational change of the cell .i.e. opening from inside to opening outside

Electrochemical gradient:
* potential difference sets up due to higher concentration of Na+ outside and lower concentration of Na+ inside; increased +ve charge
* due to movement of Na+ against concentration gradient
* void concentration_indicator(void): indicator to show the rise in concentration or potential gradient build up

Channel protein:
* pathway for glucose to pass through from lower concentration to higher concentration via. symporters (Secondary Active Transport)
* void channel_protein(void):
    * consist of two gates
    * one opening to let the outside molecules come in; i.e. from outside environment to inside
    * another one that lets the molecule from the outside to pass in to inside of the cell
