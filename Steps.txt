2D implementation
Sodium Potassium pump:
* movement of ions against their concentration gradient 
* 3Na+ for every 2K+
* movement on the expense of energy released on phosphorylsis of ATP to ADP and energy

Na+:
* circular in shape with "Na+" written on it.
* show fluidic motion #camera function : +X
* higher concentration outside, lower inside the plasma membrane 

K+:
* circular in shape with K+ written on it
* radius K+>Na+
* higher concentation inside, lower on the outside of plasma membrane
* show fluidic motion #camera function : -X

Glucose:
* movement of glucose on expense of energy from electro-chemical gradient

ATP action:
* attaches itself to the cell by phosphorylsis action releasing ADP and energy
* this energy is responsible for conformational change of the cell .i.e. opening from inside to opening outside

Electrochemical gradient:
* potential difference that sets up due to higher concentration of Na+ outside and lower concentration of Na+ inside
* due to movement of Na+ against concentration gradient

Channel protein:
* pathway for glucose to pass through from lower concentration to higher concentration via. symporters (Secondary Active Transport)
